          id: "slide-2-1",
          title: "Instruction",
          content: `
            The instruction is the command or directive specifying what you want the AI to do. 
            Clarity and directness are critical.
            
            ## Examples of Instructions
            
            - "Summarize the following article in one sentence."
            - "Translate this text to French."
            - "Write a Python script that greets the user."
          `
        },
        {
          id: "slide-2-2",
          title: "Context",
          content: `
            Providing context means supplying any additional information that helps the AI understand 
            the task betterâ€”this may include the purpose, audience, background details, or constraints 
            on style and length.
            
            ## Why Context Matters
            
            - It focuses the output on what truly matters
            - It can reduce ambiguous or generic responses
            - Helps maintain consistency across multiple prompts

          title: "Input Data",
          content: `
            This is the data or text that the AI should operate on. In many tasks (e.g., summarization, 
            translation, classification), you provide the text or other data to be processed.
            
            ## Best Practices
            
            - Clearly separate input data from instructions
            - Format data in a way that's easy for the model to process
            - Consider using delimiters (triple quotes, brackets, etc.) for clarity

            An output indicator tells the model what format or style the answer should take 
            (e.g., bullet points, JSON, code snippet, short paragraph).
            
            ## Example
            
            "Produce the answer in valid JSON format."

          title: "Zero-Shot Prompting",
          content: `
            Zero-shot prompting involves asking the model to perform a task without providing any examples. 
            The instruction is all that's given, relying on the model's pre-existing knowledge.
            
            ## When to Use
            
            For straightforward tasks where the model's training data already covers the topic.
            
            ## Benefits
            
            Simplicity and speed of implementation.

          title: "Few-Shot Prompting",
          content: `
            Few-shot prompting includes a handful of examples within the prompt. These examples illustrate 
            the desired behavior, helping the model to generalize from them.
            
            ## How It Works
            
            You supply one or more inputâ€“output pairs before the actual task, which guides the model 
            toward the correct output format.
            
            ## Benefits
            
            Improved accuracy for more complex tasks and when the expected output format is specific.

          title: "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting",
          content: `
            Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to think through a problem step by step before 
            arriving at a final answer.
            
            ## Application
            
            Particularly effective in reasoning and arithmetic problems.
            
            ## Example
            
            "Let's think step by step" may be prefixed to the prompt to trigger intermediate reasoning steps.

          title: "Role and Context-Based Prompting",
          content: `
            Defining the role or persona of the AI can help steer its responses. For example, setting the role 
            as "a technical expert" versus "a friendly advisor" can significantly change the tone and depth of the response.
            
            ## Example
            
            "You are a professional customer service agent. Answer the following question clearly and concisely."
          `

          title: "Start Simple and Iterate",
          content: `
            Begin with a simple prompt and gradually increase its complexity by adding necessary context or examples. 
            This iterative process helps identify which elements most influence the model's performance.
            
            ## Tip
            
            Experiment with different variations and record the outputs to determine which approach yields the best results.

        {

          title: "Be Specific and Concise",
          content: `
            Clarity is key. Avoid ambiguous or overly complex language. Instead, focus on clear and direct 
            instructions that leave little room for misinterpretation.
            
            ## Advice
            
            Instead of saying "Write something about AI," specify "Write a 200-word summary on the impact of AI in healthcare."
          `
        },
        {
          id: "slide-4-3",
          title: "Provide Relevant Examples",
          content: `
            When using few-shot prompting, choose examples that are as close as possible to the task at hand. 
            This helps reduce confusion and guides the model toward producing consistent outputs.
            
            ## Best Practice
            
            Use consistent formatting in your examples so that the pattern is unmistakable.
          `
        },
        {
          id: "slide-4-4",
          title: "Avoid Negative Instructions",
          content: `
            Rather than telling the model what not to do, focus on instructing it on what should be done. 
            Negative instructions (e.g., "Do not ask for personal information") can sometimes be ignored. 
            Instead, frame your prompt with positive instructions.
            
            ## Example Improvement
            
            "Provide a list of trending movies without referencing personal data" is clearer than a list of prohibitions.

            - **Experiment Boldly:** Don't be afraid to try new structures or instructions. The most effective prompts often come from iterative experimentation.
            
            - **Document Your Findings:** Keep track of prompt variations and outcomes. This documentation can be invaluable for refining techniques over time.
            
            - **Stay Updated:** Follow the latest research and community developments, as prompt engineering is a fast-moving field.
            
            - **Focus on Clarity:** Always aim for clear, unambiguous language in your prompts. The simpler and more direct the instruction, the better the model's performance.
            
            - **Design for Specificity:** Tailor your prompt to the task at hand. The more the prompt aligns with the intended outcome, the more reliably the model will respond in the desired manner.
