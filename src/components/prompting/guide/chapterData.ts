        title: 'The Art of Clear Communication',
        content: `## Why Clarity Matters

AI is powerful, but it needs **clear direction** to help you effectively. Think of prompting like giving directions to a very capable assistant.

## Key Principles

- **Be specific** about what you want
- **Provide context** for better understanding
- **Break down complex requests** into smaller steps
- **Use examples** when helpful

## Example: Vague vs. Clear

**Vague:** "Make a button"

**Clear:** "Create a blue primary button with white text that says 'Get Started' and navigates to the signup page when clicked"

The clear version gives the AI everything it needs to help you succeed.`
      },
      {
        id: 'slide-2-2',
        title: 'Structure and Context',
        content: `## Providing Context

Always give the AI context about:
- **What you're building** (e.g., "a fitness tracking app")
- **Who it's for** (e.g., "busy professionals")
- **What problem it solves** (e.g., "quick workout logging")

## Structured Requests

Break complex requests into clear sections:

1. **Goal:** What you want to achieve
2. **Requirements:** Must-have features
3. **Constraints:** Limitations or preferences
4. **Examples:** Similar functionality you like

## Example Structure

"I'm building a task management app for remote teams. I need a component that displays team member status (online/offline/busy) with their profile picture and current task. It should update in real-time and match our blue and white color scheme."

This gives the AI everything needed for success!`

      {
        id: 'slide-2-3',
        title: 'Iteration and Refinement',
        content: `## The Power of Iteration

Great results often come through **refinement**. Don't expect perfection on the first try—embrace the iterative process!

## Effective Refinement Strategies

- **Start broad, then narrow down**
- **Ask for specific adjustments**
- **Build on what works**
- **Reference previous outputs**

## Example Iteration Flow

1. "Create a contact form"
2. "Add validation to the email field"
3. "Make the submit button more prominent"
4. "Add a success message after submission"

## Pro Tips

- **Be specific** about what needs changing
- **Explain why** something isn't working
- **Reference** specific parts of the output
- **Build incrementally** rather than starting over

Remember: Every expert started as a beginner. Each iteration makes you better!`

        content: `## What Are Components?

Components are **reusable building blocks** of your application. Think of them like LEGO pieces—each serves a specific purpose and can be combined to create larger structures.

## Benefits of Component Thinking

- **Reusability:** Write once, use everywhere
- **Maintainability:** Changes in one place update everywhere
- **Clarity:** Each component has a single responsibility
- **Collaboration:** Teams can work on different components simultaneously

## Common Component Types

- **UI Components:** Buttons, forms, cards
- **Layout Components:** Headers, sidebars, grids
- **Feature Components:** User profiles, product listings
- **Page Components:** Complete page layouts

## Example

Instead of "create a product page," think:
- Header component
- Product image gallery component
- Product details component
- Add to cart component
- Related products component

This approach leads to better, more maintainable code!`

      {
        id: 'slide-3-2',
        title: 'Designing Reusable Components',
        content: `## Principles of Reusable Design

**Single Responsibility:** Each component should do one thing well.

**Configurable:** Use props to customize behavior and appearance.

**Predictable:** Same inputs should always produce same outputs.

## Component Anatomy

A well-designed component includes:
- **Clear purpose** and responsibility
- **Flexible props** for customization
- **Consistent styling** that fits your design system
- **Proper error handling**
- **Accessibility features**

## Example: Button Component

Instead of multiple similar buttons, create one flexible button:

\`\`\`typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
  size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
\`\`\`

This one component can handle all your button needs while maintaining consistency!`

      {
        id: 'slide-3-3',
        title: 'Component Composition',
        content: `## Building with Components

**Composition** is the art of combining simple components to create complex interfaces. Like assembling furniture from parts, you build UIs from components.

## Composition Strategies

**Container and Content Pattern:**
- Wrapper component provides structure
- Content components provide functionality

**Compound Components:**
- Related components that work together
- Example: Card, CardHeader, CardContent, CardFooter

**Higher-Order Components:**
- Components that enhance other components
- Example: WithLoading, WithAuth

## Example: Dashboard Layout

\`\`\`typescript
<DashboardLayout>
  <Sidebar>
    <Navigation />
    <UserProfile />
  </Sidebar>
  <MainContent>
    <Header title="Analytics" />
    <MetricsGrid>
      <MetricCard title="Users" value="1,234" />
      <MetricCard title="Revenue" value="$5,678" />
    </MetricsGrid>
  </MainContent>
</DashboardLayout>
\`\`\`

Each component is simple, but together they create a powerful interface!`

Large, complex requests can overwhelm both AI and humans. The secret is **decomposition**—breaking big problems into manageable pieces.

## The DIVIDE Strategy

**D**efine the overall goal
**I**dentify key components  
**V**alidate requirements
**I**mplement incrementally
**D**ebug and refine
**E**valuate and optimize

## Example: E-commerce Platform

Instead of: "Build an e-commerce site"

Break it down:
1. User authentication system
2. Product catalog and search
3. Shopping cart functionality
4. Payment processing
5. Order management
6. Admin dashboard

        title: 'Context Management',
        content: `## Why Context Matters

AI performs best when it understands the **full picture** of what you're building. Context helps AI make better decisions about implementation details.

## Types of Context

**Project Context:**
- Application purpose and target users
- Technical stack and constraints
- Design system and brand guidelines

**Technical Context:**
- Existing code structure
- Dependencies and libraries
- Performance requirements

**Business Context:**
- User needs and pain points
- Success metrics
- Timeline and resources

## Example: Context-Rich Prompt

"I'm building a fitness app for busy professionals using React and TypeScript. The app uses a blue/green color scheme and focuses on quick, 15-minute workouts. I need a workout timer component that:
- Shows elapsed time and remaining time
- Allows pausing/resuming
- Plays audio cues at intervals
- Matches our minimal design aesthetic
- Works well on mobile devices"

This context helps AI understand not just *what* to build, but *how* it should fit into your larger system.`

        title: 'Error Handling and Edge Cases',
        content: `## Anticipating Problems

Great applications handle errors gracefully. When prompting, think about what could go wrong and ask for appropriate error handling.

## Common Edge Cases

**Data Issues:**
- Empty states (no data to display)
- Loading states (data not ready yet)
- Error states (failed to load data)

**User Input:**
- Invalid form submissions
- Network connectivity issues
- Permission restrictions

**System Limitations:**
- API rate limits
- Browser compatibility
- Performance constraints

## Prompting for Robust Code

Instead of: "Create a user profile component"

Try: "Create a user profile component that handles loading states while fetching data, shows a friendly message when the profile is empty, and gracefully handles API errors with retry options. Include form validation for profile updates."

## Best Practices

- **Always ask** for error handling
- **Specify** expected error scenarios
- **Request** user-friendly error messages
- **Include** fallback options

Robust applications delight users even when things go wrong!`

        title: 'API Fundamentals',
        content: `## Understanding APIs

**APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** are the bridges that enable different software systems to communicate. Think of them as translators that help applications speak the same language.

## How APIs Work

1. **Your Application** makes a request
2. **The API** processes the request
3. **External Service** performs the action
4. **Response** is sent back with results

## API Communication Methods

**REST APIs:** Most common, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
**GraphQL:** Query language for more flexible data fetching
**WebSockets:** Real-time, bidirectional communication
**Webhooks:** External services notify your app of events

## Authentication Methods

**API Keys:** Simple tokens for service identification
**OAuth:** Secure user authorization (login with Google)
**JWT Tokens:** Self-contained authentication tokens
**Bearer Tokens:** Simple authorization headers

## API Best Practices

- **Secure API Keys:** Never expose them in client-side code
- **Handle Rate Limits:** Respect service usage limits
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully manage failed requests
- **Caching:** Store responses to improve performance

Lovable handles much of this complexity for you, but understanding the basics helps you make better integration decisions!`

**Precise prompting is crucial** for effective debugging. The quality of your questions directly impacts the usefulness of the AI's diagnostic assistance.

## Investigation Prompts

**Before Making Changes:**
- "Suggest 3 ways to implement X without writing code yet"
- "Investigate but don't write code—what could be causing this?"
- "Help me understand why this component might not be rendering"
- "What are the most likely causes of this API error?"

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- "Why might the login function return undefined?"
- "What could cause this component to re-render infinitely?"
- "Why would this API call work in development but fail in production?"
- "What security issues could cause this authentication error?"

## Specific Problem Queries

**Error-Focused Questions:**
- "This error says 'Cannot read property X of undefined'—what's the likely cause?"
- "I'm getting a CORS error when calling this API—what should I check?"
- "The component loads but the data doesn't appear—where should I look?"
- "My form submits but doesn't update the database—what could be wrong?"

**Behavior Analysis:**
- "The button click works sometimes but not others—what could cause this?"
- "Data loads on desktop but not mobile—what might be different?"
- "The component looks right but doesn't respond to clicks—what should I check?"

## Evidence-Based Prompting

**Provide Specific Details:**
- Include exact error messages and stack traces

        content: `## Beyond Surface-Level Fixes

**True debugging goes deeper than symptoms**—it uncovers the fundamental reasons why problems occur, preventing future issues and building more robust applications.

## The "Why?" Method

**Don't Just Fix—Understand:**
- Surface symptoms are often not the real problem
- Quick fixes may mask deeper architectural issues
- Understanding root causes prevents recurring problems
- Knowledge gained helps with future debugging

**The Five Whys Technique:**
1. **Why did this error occur?** "The API call failed"
2. **Why did the API call fail?** "Authentication token was missing"
3. **Why was the token missing?** "User session expired"
4. **Why did the session expire?** "Token refresh logic isn't working"
5. **Why isn't refresh logic working?** "Missing error handling for refresh failures"

## Common Root Causes

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Session management issues
- Token expiration handling
- Permission scope problems
- Redirect logic failures

**Data Flow Problems:**
- State management inconsistencies
- Prop drilling issues
- Async operation timing
- Component lifecycle mismatches

**Integration Issues:**
- API versioning conflicts
- Configuration environment differences
- Service dependency failures
- Rate limiting and throttling

## Systematic Investigation

**Look for Patterns:**
- Does this happen with specific user actions?
- Are certain data types or values problematic?
- Does the issue occur at particular times?
- Is it related to specific user roles or permissions?

**Examine Dependencies:**
- What external services are involved?
- Which internal components interact with this feature?
- How does data flow through the system?
- Where are the potential failure points?

## Building Robust Solutions

**Address the Real Problem:**
- Fix the underlying cause, not just the symptom
- Implement proper error handling
- Add validation at appropriate points
- Design for failure scenarios

**Prevent Future Issues:**
- Add logging for debugging future problems
- Implement health checks and monitoring
- Document the solution and the reasoning
- Consider similar issues that might exist elsewhere

## Example Analysis

**Symptom:** User profile image doesn't display
**Surface Fix:** Add a default image
**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Why no image? → Upload failed silently
- Why did upload fail? → File size too large
- Why no size validation? → Frontend validation missing
- Why missing validation? → Requirements not specified
**Better Solution:** Add file size validation, error handling, and user feedback

Asking "Why?" transforms debugging from fixing problems to preventing them!`

        content: `## Building Safety Nets

**Robust version control strategies** protect your work and enable seamless recovery from errors, ensuring you can always return to a working state when experiments go wrong.

## Pinning Stable Versions

**Creating Reliable Checkpoints:**
- Mark stable milestones as you reach them
- Pin versions before major feature additions
- Create restore points before risky changes
- Document why each version was pinned

**Strategic Pinning Times:**
- **Feature Completion:** After successfully implementing new functionality
- **Before Experiments:** Prior to trying new approaches or technologies
- **Production Deployments:** Before pushing to live environments
- **Integration Points:** After successfully connecting external services

**Version Documentation:**
- **What Works:** Clear description of functioning features
- **Known Issues:** Any minor problems that exist
- **Next Steps:** Planned improvements or additions
- **Dependencies:** External services and configurations required

## Smart Rollback Strategy

**When to Roll Back:**
- New changes introduce more problems than they solve
- "Try to Fix" attempts make issues worse
- Complex features become unstable
- Multiple systems start failing simultaneously

**Clean Rollback Process:**
1. **Stop Making Changes:** Don't try to fix forward when stuck
2. **Assess the Situation:** Identify what was working before
3. **Choose Restore Point:** Select appropriate stable version
4. **Communicate the Rollback:** Inform the AI about the revert
5. **Start Fresh:** Begin again with lessons learned

**Avoiding Tangled Code:**
- Don't stack quick fixes on top of broken implementations
- Revert to clean state rather than patching problems
- Start with working foundation and rebuild incrementally
- Document what didn't work to avoid repeating mistakes

## Database Considerations

**Supabase Schema Changes:**
- Database migrations don't automatically revert with code
- Plan schema changes carefully before implementation
- Test database changes in development first
- Consider backward compatibility when possible

**Handling Schema Rollbacks:**
- Document database state at each pinned version
- Plan migration reversal strategies
- Test rollback procedures in development
- Coordinate schema changes with code deployments

## GitHub Integration Best Practices

**Branch Strategy:**
- Use feature branches for experimental changes
