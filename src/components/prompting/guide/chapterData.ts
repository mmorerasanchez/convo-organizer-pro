        title: 'The Art of Clear Communication',
        content: `## Why Clarity Matters

AI is powerful, but it needs **clear direction** to help you effectively. Think of prompting like giving directions to a very capable assistant.

## Key Principles

- **Be specific** about what you want
- **Provide context** for better understanding
- **Break down complex requests** into smaller steps
- **Use examples** when helpful

## Example: Vague vs. Clear

**Vague:** "Make a button"

**Clear:** "Create a blue primary button with white text that says 'Get Started' and navigates to the signup page when clicked"

The clear version gives the AI everything it needs to help you succeed.`
      },
      {
        id: 'slide-2-2',
        title: 'Structure and Context',
        content: `## Providing Context

Always give the AI context about:
- **What you're building** (e.g., "a fitness tracking app")
- **Who it's for** (e.g., "busy professionals")
- **What problem it solves** (e.g., "quick workout logging")

## Structured Requests

Break complex requests into clear sections:

1. **Goal:** What you want to achieve
2. **Requirements:** Must-have features
3. **Constraints:** Limitations or preferences
4. **Examples:** Similar functionality you like

## Example Structure

"I'm building a task management app for remote teams. I need a component that displays team member status (online/offline/busy) with their profile picture and current task. It should update in real-time and match our blue and white color scheme."

This gives the AI everything needed for success!`

      {
        id: 'slide-2-3',
        title: 'Iteration and Refinement',
        content: `## The Power of Iteration

Great results often come through **refinement**. Don't expect perfection on the first try—embrace the iterative process!

## Effective Refinement Strategies

- **Start broad, then narrow down**
- **Ask for specific adjustments**
- **Build on what works**
- **Reference previous outputs**

## Example Iteration Flow

1. "Create a contact form"
2. "Add validation to the email field"
3. "Make the submit button more prominent"
4. "Add a success message after submission"

## Pro Tips

- **Be specific** about what needs changing
- **Explain why** something isn't working
- **Reference** specific parts of the output
- **Build incrementally** rather than starting over

Remember: Every expert started as a beginner. Each iteration makes you better!`

        title: 'Thinking in Components',
        content: `## What Are Components?

Components are **reusable building blocks** of your application. Think of them like LEGO pieces—each serves a specific purpose and can be combined to create larger structures.

## Benefits of Component Thinking

- **Reusability:** Write once, use everywhere
- **Maintainability:** Changes in one place update everywhere
- **Clarity:** Each component has a single responsibility
- **Collaboration:** Teams can work on different components simultaneously

## Common Component Types

- **UI Components:** Buttons, forms, cards
- **Layout Components:** Headers, sidebars, grids
- **Feature Components:** User profiles, product listings
- **Page Components:** Complete page layouts

## Example

Instead of "create a product page," think:
- Header component
- Product image gallery component
- Product details component
- Add to cart component
- Related products component

This approach leads to better, more maintainable code!`

      {
        id: 'slide-3-2',
        title: 'Designing Reusable Components',
        content: `## Principles of Reusable Design

**Single Responsibility:** Each component should do one thing well.

**Configurable:** Use props to customize behavior and appearance.

**Predictable:** Same inputs should always produce same outputs.

## Component Anatomy

A well-designed component includes:
- **Clear purpose** and responsibility
- **Flexible props** for customization
- **Consistent styling** that fits your design system
- **Proper error handling**
- **Accessibility features**

## Example: Button Component

Instead of multiple similar buttons, create one flexible button:

\`\`\`typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
  size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
\`\`\`

This one component can handle all your button needs while maintaining consistency!`

      {
        id: 'slide-3-3',
        title: 'Component Composition',
        content: `## Building with Components

**Composition** is the art of combining simple components to create complex interfaces. Like assembling furniture from parts, you build UIs from components.

## Composition Strategies

**Container and Content Pattern:**
- Wrapper component provides structure
- Content components provide functionality

**Compound Components:**
- Related components that work together
- Example: Card, CardHeader, CardContent, CardFooter

**Higher-Order Components:**
- Components that enhance other components
- Example: WithLoading, WithAuth

## Example: Dashboard Layout

\`\`\`typescript
<DashboardLayout>
  <Sidebar>
    <Navigation />
    <UserProfile />
  </Sidebar>
  <MainContent>
    <Header title="Analytics" />
    <MetricsGrid>
      <MetricCard title="Users" value="1,234" />
      <MetricCard title="Revenue" value="$5,678" />
    </MetricsGrid>
  </MainContent>
</DashboardLayout>
\`\`\`

Each component is simple, but together they create a powerful interface!`

Large, complex requests can overwhelm both AI and humans. The secret is **decomposition**—breaking big problems into manageable pieces.

## The DIVIDE Strategy

**D**efine the overall goal
**I**dentify key components  
**V**alidate requirements
**I**mplement incrementally
**D**ebug and refine
**E**valuate and optimize

## Example: E-commerce Platform

Instead of: "Build an e-commerce site"

Break it down:
1. User authentication system
2. Product catalog and search
3. Shopping cart functionality
4. Payment processing
5. Order management
6. Admin dashboard

## Benefits

- **Clearer requirements** for each step
- **Easier debugging** when issues arise
- **Better progress tracking**
- **More focused AI responses**

        title: 'Context Management',
        content: `## Why Context Matters

AI performs best when it understands the **full picture** of what you're building. Context helps AI make better decisions about implementation details.

## Types of Context

**Project Context:**
- Application purpose and target users
- Technical stack and constraints
- Design system and brand guidelines

**Technical Context:**
- Existing code structure
- Dependencies and libraries
- Performance requirements

**Business Context:**
- User needs and pain points
- Success metrics
- Timeline and resources

## Example: Context-Rich Prompt

"I'm building a fitness app for busy professionals using React and TypeScript. The app uses a blue/green color scheme and focuses on quick, 15-minute workouts. I need a workout timer component that:
- Shows elapsed time and remaining time
- Allows pausing/resuming
- Plays audio cues at intervals
- Matches our minimal design aesthetic
- Works well on mobile devices"

This context helps AI understand not just *what* to build, but *how* it should fit into your larger system.`

        title: 'Error Handling and Edge Cases',
        content: `## Anticipating Problems

Great applications handle errors gracefully. When prompting, think about what could go wrong and ask for appropriate error handling.

## Common Edge Cases

**Data Issues:**
- Empty states (no data to display)
- Loading states (data not ready yet)
- Error states (failed to load data)

**User Input:**
- Invalid form submissions
- Network connectivity issues
- Permission restrictions

**System Limitations:**
- API rate limits
- Browser compatibility
- Performance constraints

## Prompting for Robust Code

Instead of: "Create a user profile component"

Try: "Create a user profile component that handles loading states while fetching data, shows a friendly message when the profile is empty, and gracefully handles API errors with retry options. Include form validation for profile updates."

## Best Practices

- **Always ask** for error handling
- **Specify** expected error scenarios
- **Request** user-friendly error messages
- **Include** fallback options

Robust applications delight users even when things go wrong!`

        title: 'API Fundamentals',
        content: `## Understanding APIs

**APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** are the bridges that enable different software systems to communicate. Think of them as translators that help applications speak the same language.

## How APIs Work

1. **Your Application** makes a request
2. **The API** processes the request
3. **External Service** performs the action
4. **Response** is sent back with results

## API Communication Methods

**REST APIs:** Most common, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
**GraphQL:** Query language for more flexible data fetching
**WebSockets:** Real-time, bidirectional communication
**Webhooks:** External services notify your app of events

## Authentication Methods

**API Keys:** Simple tokens for service identification
**OAuth:** Secure user authorization (login with Google)
**JWT Tokens:** Self-contained authentication tokens
**Bearer Tokens:** Simple authorization headers

## API Best Practices

- **Secure API Keys:** Never expose them in client-side code
- **Handle Rate Limits:** Respect service usage limits
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully manage failed requests
- **Caching:** Store responses to improve performance

Lovable handles much of this complexity for you, but understanding the basics helps you make better integration decisions!`

        content: `## Why Performance Matters

**Performance directly impacts user experience** and business success. Slow applications frustrate users, hurt conversion rates, and damage your reputation.

## Key Performance Metrics

**Loading Performance:**
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** When users see first content
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** When main content is visible
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** When page becomes fully interactive

**Runtime Performance:**
- **Input Delay:** Responsiveness to user interactions
- **Frame Rate:** Smoothness of animations and scrolling
- **Memory Usage:** Efficient resource utilization

## Performance Goals

- **Page load under 3 seconds** on average connections
- **Immediate response** to user interactions (< 100ms)
- **Smooth animations** at 60 FPS
- **Minimal memory leaks** and efficient cleanup

## Common Performance Bottlenecks

**Large Bundle Sizes:**
- Too much JavaScript loaded at once
- Unused dependencies and code
- Images and assets not optimized

**Network Issues:**
- Too many HTTP requests
- Slow API responses
- Missing compression and caching

**Rendering Problems:**
- Inefficient React re-renders
- Complex DOM manipulations
- Blocking main thread operations

Understanding these fundamentals helps you build faster, more efficient applications!`

        content: `## Writing Efficient Code

**Smart coding practices** can dramatically improve your application's performance without complex optimization tools.

## React Optimization Techniques

**Minimize Re-renders:**
- Use \`React.memo()\` for expensive components
- Implement \`useMemo()\` for expensive calculations
- Apply \`useCallback()\` for stable function references
- Split components to isolate state changes

**Efficient State Management:**
- Keep state as local as possible
- Avoid unnecessary state updates
- Use state updater functions for complex updates
- Consider state normalization for complex data

## Code Splitting Strategies

**Route-Based Splitting:**
- Load pages only when needed
- Reduce initial bundle size
- Implement loading states
- Preload critical routes

**Component-Based Splitting:**
- Lazy load heavy components
- Split large feature modules
- Dynamic imports for conditional features
- Progressive enhancement patterns

## Bundle Optimization

**Tree Shaking:**
- Remove unused code from bundles
- Use ES6 modules for better optimization
- Avoid importing entire libraries
- Implement proper side-effect marking

**Dependency Management:**
- Audit and remove unused packages
- Choose lighter alternative libraries
- Use CDN links for common libraries
- Implement proper versioning strategies

## Example: Optimized Component

\`\`\`typescript
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data, onUpdate }) => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => 
    data.map(item => complexCalculation(item)), [data]
  );
  
  const handleClick = useCallback((id) => 
    onUpdate(id), [onUpdate]
  );
  
  return (
    <div>
      {processedData.map(item => 
        <Item key={item.id} data={item} onClick={handleClick} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
});
\`\`\`

Small optimizations add up to significant performance improvements!`
